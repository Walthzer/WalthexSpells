This folder should contain the .DLL files you mod references (the assembly references).

To reference .DLL files used by the MageArena game, copy them from the game files.
In the setup for this modtemplate you have already been instructed to copy the `FishNet.Runtime.dll` into this folder.
Should you have missed this, you can find the file in <Steam>\Mage Arena\MageArena_Data\Managed\

If you are referencing a modded API, e.g. BlackFishAPI you should include its DLL file here. (Get it from the mods files)
